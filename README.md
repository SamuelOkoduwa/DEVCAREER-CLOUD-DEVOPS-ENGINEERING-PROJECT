# Dev Career DevOps Engineering Projects

Welcome to my Devcareer DevOps Engineering Projects repository. This repository contains a series of projects completed as part of the Devcareer Cloud DevOps Engineering Program. Each project focuses on different aspects of DevOps, Linux administration, networking, containerization, infrastructure as code (IaC), microservices, cloud deployment, monitoring, and logging.

***

##	Key Objectives:
-	Gain a deep understanding of DevOps principles, tools, and culture.
-	Master Linux administration, networking, and server configuration.
-	Acquire skills in CI/CD pipelines, containerization, and orchestration.
-	Learn IaC practices using Terraform and advanced monitoring/logging techniques.
-	Design, deploy, and manage microservices on cloud platforms with automation.
-	Demonstrate proficiency through a comprehensive final project.
