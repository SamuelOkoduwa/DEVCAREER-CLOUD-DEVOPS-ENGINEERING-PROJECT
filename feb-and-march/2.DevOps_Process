#	DevOps Process Breakdown
The DevOps process is a continuous cycle focused on collaboration, automation, and rapid feedback between development and operations teams. Here's a breakdown of the key stages:

1. **Plan & Code:** This stage involves defining requirements, designing the software, and developers writing the code. Version control systems like Git are used to track code changes and collaborate effectively.

2. **Build & Test:** The code is automatically compiled and built into a deployable format. Automated testing tools are used to identify bugs and ensure code quality at this early stage.

3. **Continuous Integration (CI):** Developers frequently commit their code changes to a central repository. With each commit, an automated build and test process is triggered. This helps catch issues early and prevents them from snowballing.

4. **Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD):** Once code passes the automated tests, it's automatically packaged and deployed to a staging environment.
The staging environment mimics the production environment, allowing for final testing before deployment.
In some DevOps models, deployment to production can also be automated (Continuous Deployment).

5. **Monitor & Feedback:** The deployed application is continuously monitored for performance, errors, and security vulnerabilities.
User feedback and real-world data are also collected.
This information is fed back to the development team for further improvements and iteration.

**Here's what each stage represents:**
-	Plan & Code: This stage lays the foundation for the software and establishes a collaborative development environment.
-	Build & Test: Ensures the code is built correctly and functions as expected before deployment.
-	CI: Promotes early detection of bugs and fosters a culture of continuous improvement.
-	CD: Automates the delivery pipeline, making deployments faster and more reliable.
-	Monitor & Feedback: Provides valuable data for improving the application and user experience.
-	By following this continuous cycle, DevOps enables faster software delivery, higher quality, and improved collaboration between development and operations teams.
